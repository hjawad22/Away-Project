# Away

## Abstract
This web application enables users to log in using a unique username and password, select their preferred travel destination, specify the number of individuals and the length of their stay. The application provides an estimated cost for the selected trip, and users can book the trip after viewing the estimation, which is then displayed in their trips section. Additionally, past trips are accessible to users upon login.
